#			since this number cannot be greater than 256 we can safely use a byte to encode this information hence the function call to chr()

#	Next 8 bytes hold the timestamp, struct.pack packs the time into a byte
#
#	Third byte holds the length of the data in the message
#
#	Rest of the package is the message, message can be up to 256 bytes.
